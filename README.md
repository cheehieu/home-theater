## Room Specs
- Light controlled, some ambient light
- L-shaped couch sitting ~14 feet away from projection surface
- Living room is a bit awkward (old house), not planned for larger TVs... a projector makes the most sense
- Awkward wall + doorway and high ceiling is approximately 130" x 120", enough room for a 100"+ projector screen

### Projector
As of late 2020, I was considering the following mid-range consumer projectors:
- Optoma CinemaX P2 ($2800)
- Epson 5050UB ($2700)
- Samsung LSP7T ($3100)
- LG HU85LA ($4500)
- VAVA 4K ($2000)

I decided to go with the VAVA 4K projector as it was on sale during Black Friday. It was cheaper, has good integrated audio, and figured that we can splurge later on as the UST technology matures. Also used the CSR's "pay yourself back" feature to save an additonal 33% with Amazon gift cards.

### Screen
Went with an Elite Screens Manual Tab-Tension 2 series screen, at 106" (https://elitescreens.com/front/front/productdetail/product/492). It was $562 on Amazon, uses the CineWhite UHD-B material, and is compatible with ultra short throw projectors.

### Stand
Found a semi-oval shaped table on FB Marketplace, measuring 52" (L) x 18" (W) x 28" (H). According to the VAVA manual, the H2 distance between the bottom of the image and the desk should be ~12.64" for a 106" screen, assuming a linear relationship.

#### Image-Desk Height Gap (H2)
P1 = (100, 12.1)
P2 = (120, 13.9)
y = 0.09x + 3.1
y = 0.09 * (106") + 3.1 = 12.64"

#### Device-Wall Distance (W1)
P1 = (100, 7.2)
P2 = (120, 11)
y = 0.19x - 11.8
y = 0.19 * (106") - 11.8 = 8.34"


## Audio
TBD. Need to do more research on receivers, surround sound set ups, subs, cabling, etc.


## Build
